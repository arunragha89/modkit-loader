# App Example

This example is just a simple `index.html` file that loads the Modkit library via CDN.

Serve it using `serve` or any http-server and enter your module url to your module.

``` bash
# Install serve globally
npm i -g serve
# Serve the file
serve --cors
```

## Usage

Enter an url to any module manifest in the `input` and load it.
You can find the currently loaded modules at the bottom of the `input` if any there are any, along with `unload` buttons.
