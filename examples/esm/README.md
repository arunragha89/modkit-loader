# Esm Example

This example shows how to handle module dependencies.

The [UMD sample](https://github.com/genesys/modkit-loader/tree/master/examples/umd) is added as a dependency, therefore it will be required prior to load.

It justs enhances the existing [UMD sample](https://github.com/genesys/modkit-loader/tree/master/examples/umd) by adding a new [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/) badge.
